-- conformed.dim_project -- Oracle Fusion warehouse, staged 1:1 into `fusion`.
--
-- GENERATED, then yours: this file was written from the warehouse schema, but
-- it is an ordinary model. Edit it freely; nothing regenerates it. (The source
-- declaration and the Iceberg path ARE regenerated -- see gui/ofusion_sources.py.)
--
-- Grain: project_id (UNVERIFIED -- table is empty)
-- Columns arrive Nullable, so the sorting-key columns are coalesced here:
-- ClickHouse rejects a MergeTree sorting key over nullable columns.
-- LAST_UPDATE_DATE also arrives as a STRING from this (empty) table, and
-- ReplacingMergeTree will not take a String version column, so it is parsed to
-- DateTime64(6) here -- the same type the populated models already expose.
--
-- The warehouse table is STILL EMPTY, so this grain could not be measured: the
-- sorting key is inferred from the Fusion table's natural key, and is chosen
-- deliberately WIDE. Under ReplacingMergeTree a key that is too wide only
-- skips dedup, while one that is too narrow silently collapses distinct rows.
-- The `unique_combination_final` test on this key in _ofusion__models.yml
-- fails the run as soon as real data contradicts the guess.
--
-- Incremental: appends rows whose LAST_UPDATE_DATE is newer than anything
-- loaded, and ReplacingMergeTree(last_update_date) collapses an updated row
-- against its earlier version on merge. A row whose LAST_UPDATE_DATE is NULL
-- loads on the first full build and is not picked up by later runs.
